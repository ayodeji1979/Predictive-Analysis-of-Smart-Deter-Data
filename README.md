# PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS OF SNART METER DATA
This repository cotains the file for a predictive analysis of smart meter data using machine learning models to predict household electricity consumption.

## Introduction
The project involved a comprehensive analysis OF snary meter data. The analysis was done using exploratory data analysis for data preprocessing and data manipulations. However, we used six machine learning models to predict energy consumption in london household. Seven days data was used to predict the next day. Before the training and testing process, a sliding window algorithm was used to convert the data from univiriatr data to multiple inputs and outputs of the NumPy array. The performances of the six models were evaluated using Mean Squared Error and R_Squared Score and recommendedation was made for decision-making.

## Key Methods
- Python: Pandas
- Sliding Window
- Machine Learning models: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regressor, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, LSTM, ans BiLSTM.
- Metrics: MSE, R_squared

## Implementation
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Model Development
